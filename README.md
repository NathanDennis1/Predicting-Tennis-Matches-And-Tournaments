## Project Description:

We plan to investigate if we can accurately predict the winner of a given doubles match through assigning a probability that a team will beat another. ELO scores will be used for each player to determine probabilites. We hope to use past tennis doubles match data and develop a methodology to assign these probabilities with data such as past match statistics for players. We also will incorporate different statistics such as tournaments, surfaces, and past experiences to adjust players ratings for a given match.
