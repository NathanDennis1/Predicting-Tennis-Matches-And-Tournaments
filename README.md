# Predicting Tennis Matches and Tournaments

## Group Members:
Nathan Dennis, John Breedis, Yiming Chen (Team 19)

## Project Description:

We plan to investigate if we can accurately predict the winner of a given tennis match through assigning a probability that a player will beat another. There are many factors that go into predicting tennis matches, which we hope to analyze. ELO scores will be used for each player to determine probabilites of winning a given match, separated by tennis surfaces. We plan to use past tennis match data and develop a methodology to assign probabilities of winning, using data such as past match statistics for players and features about players such as their age, height, handedness, etc. We also will incorporate different statistics such as tournaments and surfaces to adjust players ratings for a given match.
